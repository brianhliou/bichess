 * Trim the unsound tail off every engine sideline in the articles.
 *
 *   node scripts/trim-sideline-tails.mjs            # measure, report, write nothing
 *   node scripts/trim-sideline-tails.mjs --write    # edit the article sources
 *
 * A stored `line` is a principal variation, and a PV's tail is the least
 * verified part of a search: those moves come out of the transposition table and
 * are never re-checked the way the root is. So a line routinely ends on a move
 * the engine would never play. That was invisible while the line's verdict was
 * ALSO measured at the tail (the two errors cancelled into a confident wrong
 * answer); with the verdict now taken at the root, the bad tail is all that is
 * left, and it is the part the reader actually steps through.
 *
 * The rule: drop the final move when it BOTH costs the side playing it more than
 * THRESHOLD centipawns AND is not the move the engine plays in that position.
 * Repeat, because the move before it is often no better. Stop at a move that
 * holds, or at MIN_LEN so a line is never trimmed away to nothing.
 *
 * Both halves are needed. Cost alone eats forced moves: in a lost position every
 * legal move loses more ground as the mate approaches, so a cost-only rule
 * trimmed one line from 15 moves to 8 while every move in it was the best
 * available. Requiring the move to also differ from the engine's choice is what
 * makes the rule mean "a move the engine would not play".
 *
 * This does not re-derive the line. Re-running the whole analysis would change
 * every board on both pages; trimming removes only the moves that were never
 * trustworthy and leaves the rest of the published line as it is.
 *
 * Verdicts are unaffected: they are measured at the line's ROOT, which trimming
 * does not move. No re-measure is needed after this.
