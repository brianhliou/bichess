// The FITTING half of the win-curve calibration. `calibrate-win-curve.mjs`
// collects samples (position eval + the result of the game it came from); this
// turns them into the numbers quoted in the packages/game/src/analysis.ts header:
// the best-fit K, its ratio to the chess constant, the log-loss both ways, the
// by-game bootstrap CI, and the near-equality band check.
//
//   node scripts/calibrate-win-curve.mjs 70      # writes tmp/win-curve-samples.json
//   node scripts/fit-win-curve.mjs               # reads it, prints the report
//   node scripts/fit-win-curve.mjs --in tmp/x.json --boot 2000
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Before 2026-09-01 it did not, and that was the real gap:
// the 2026-08-27 note quoted K = 0.00623, a 1.69x ratio, log-loss 0.6219 ->
// 0.6124 and a CI of 0.0033-0.0114, but the only committed code stopped at
// sample collection. The headline numbers were computed off to one side and
// never shipped, so "the script reproduces it" was never true of the result --
// only of the inputs. A number in a comment that no code can regenerate is a
// number that will be re-derived by hand, differently, by whoever needs it next.
//
// BOOTSTRAP BY GAME, NOT BY SAMPLE. Positions inside one game share that game's
// result, so they are not independent observations; ~856 samples is closer to 70.
// Resampling rows instead of games understates the CI by roughly the average
// number of samples per game, which is exactly the error that would make a
// 1.69x point estimate look decisive.
