// Standard-xiangqi (open / perfect-info) adapter for the shared GameTree spine.
// Every hook is a one-liner over the existing `@mistboard/game` kernel — the same
// functions xiangqi-review-model.ts already uses to replay a move list. This is
// the first concrete VariantTreeAdapter and the proof that open variants need no
// new rules code to ride the tree: Truth = XiangqiGameState, View =
// StandardXiangqiPlayerView, and `project` returns a single truth view (length 1).
// The fog counterpart (dark xiangqi) will share every hook except `project`,
// which returns the truth + per-POV triptych (length 3).
