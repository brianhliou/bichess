// The declined-offer half of `!!` (#315). When a move offers a piece and the
// engine's own line does NOT take it, the classifier cannot settle whether the
// piece comes back, reports `sacrifice-unverified`, and stays silent. The sweep
// therefore searches the position AFTER the capture and stores that line.
//
// This pins the two things that are easy to get wrong: that the extra search is
// rare (it must not fire on quiet plies) and that it is asked for the right
// position — the game so far, plus the accepting capture.
