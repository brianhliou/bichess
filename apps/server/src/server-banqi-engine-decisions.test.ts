/**
 * Banqi PvE: the SUCCESS path records what the engine did.
 *
 * The failure path has always produced a full decision record; a move that
 * worked produced nothing at all, so "is this bot using the budget we give it?"
 * had no retrospective answer for banqi — only live logs, which die with the
 * container. That is the exact shape of the fog-xiangqi bug that ran for weeks
 * at ~1.8% of its allotted budget before telemetry made it visible.
