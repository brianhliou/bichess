// request and both WebSocket upgrade paths resolve through), so an entry
// carries the identity fields the endpoint needs and no DB round trip happens
// at read time. Entries age out after PRESENCE_TTL_MS; live room connections
// are re-touched by the endpoint (see routes/meta.ts) so a player mid-game
// with an open socket but no HTTP traffic stays listed.
//
// Deliberately process-local: presence is a soft signal, losing it on restart
// is fine (the next authed request repopulates it).
