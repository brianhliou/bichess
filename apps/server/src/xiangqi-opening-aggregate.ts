// Opening-explorer aggregation: fold games into per-position move statistics.
//
// The unit of input is deliberately minimal — a move list plus a result — and
// carries NO notion of where the game came from. That is the whole design
// constraint: today the corpus is one license-cleared platform export, and the
// next sources (broadcast boards as first-class games, a licensed historical
// import) must join by calling `accumulateGame` with their own move lists, not
// by teaching this module about them. Anything source-specific belongs in the
// caller (see build-xiangqi-explorer.ts, which owns the license gate).
//
// Replay runs through the real standard-xiangqi kernel rather than a coordinate
// walk, so an illegal or corrupt move list is dropped instead of poisoning the
// statistics with positions that cannot occur.
