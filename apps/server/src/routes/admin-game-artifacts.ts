/**
 * GET /api/admin/games/:roomId/artifacts?type=live-engine-decision
 *
 * One variant-agnostic reader for per-move engine telemetry. Every tenant PvE
 * loop queues its decisions into the same `game_debug_artifacts` rows keyed by
 * room id, and nothing about reading them back is variant-specific — the
 * per-variant routes that came first (routes/xiangqi-games.ts,
 * routes/dark-xiangqi-games.ts) differ only in which spec id they check. Five
 * more copies of that for banqi, jungle, flip jungle, jieqi and fortress would
 * have been five more places for the same bug. Those two stay where they are:
 * the admin UI and existing links point at them, and this route is additive.
 *
 * The 404 is the load-bearing part. An unknown room id, or an id that names no
 * finished game, is NOT `200 {"artifacts": []}`. An empty 200 for any string
 * you can type turns "wrong route", "wrong id", and "this game predates the
 * instrumentation" into the single indistinguishable answer "this engine
 * recorded nothing" — which is how a missing-instrumentation problem was
 * investigated as an engine bug for most of a session. An empty list here means
 * the game exists and genuinely has no decisions.
