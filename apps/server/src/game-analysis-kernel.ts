// Shared plumbing for the per-variant whole-game analysis/decisions resolvers.
//
// Every variant's resolver (banqi/jieqi/jungle/jungle-flip/fortress/xiangqi, both
// the Layer-1 eval sweep and the Layer-2 decision decomposition) had the same
// ~40-line skeleton: cache lookup keyed (room, engine, depth), in-flight
// coalescing so concurrent viewers share one compute, an optional fail-closed
// validation (the vacuous-sweep guard), and an idempotent cache write. That
// skeleton was copy-pasted 9x and each fix (e.g. #221) had to be hand-applied
// per copy. It now lives here once. The per-variant modules keep ONLY their
// math (position reconstruction, POV normalization, pool-mean decomposition)
// and their cache/engine-id constants — this kernel is plumbing, not math.
