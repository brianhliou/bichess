// Fairy-Stockfish standard-Xiangqi provider for the human-facing difficulty
// ladder. Unlike mainline Pikafish, FSF exposes Stockfish's stochastic Skill
// Level: internally it searches multiple root candidates and sometimes selects a
// plausible suboptimal move. Levels 1-7 copy the Lichess/PlayStrategy weakening
// profiles (skill + depth cap + short movetime) on the classical eval.
//
// Level 8 is different in kind since 2026-09-02. Until then it was skill 20,
// depth 22, 1 s, classical eval, 1 thread, 16 MB hash, on the generic FSF 14
// release binary: a 1 s single-threaded search that never reached its depth cap
// and that the EvE ladder rated ~500 Elo above a random mover. A human beat it
// in 37 moves. The top rung now runs the official FSF xiangqi NNUE net
// (+914 Elo over classical on the fairy-stockfish.github.io ladder) with a NODE
// budget as the CPU-independent strength anchor and the movetime as a latency
// ceiling only, the same contract as the Pikafish tiers and the sibling FSF
// providers (fortress, drop-mini). Measured 2026-09-02 on an M-series laptop:
// ~700k nps, so 1M nodes is ~1.5 s and reaches depth 19-20; prod's slower vCPU
// takes longer to reach the SAME nodes, which is the point of anchoring on them.
//
// The net's architecture needs a Fairy-Stockfish newer than the fairy_sf_14
// release the other FSF variants run on (FSF 14 refuses to load it and exits),
// so this provider resolves its OWN binary, built from the commit pinned in
// fairy-stockfish-xiangqi.ref, and its own net beside it. Levels 1-7 move onto
// that binary too, with `Use NNUE` forced off so their calibration does not drift.
